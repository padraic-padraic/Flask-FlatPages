upgrade:
  - |
    Accessing the .app property of FlatPages now returns the current_app
    as provider by ``flask.current_app``. This is in line with Flask's own
    guidelines to extension developers, but in some cases you might need
    to manually set the context using ``app.app_context()``.

    Trying to modify the app instance via a FlatPages instance
    will now raise an ``AttributeError.``
